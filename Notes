CSS Notes

Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.
you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, 
you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</p>

HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element. CSS can be written between opening and closing <style> tags. 
To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.

After adding a <style> tag in the head section, you can begin writing CSS code.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>


Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML 
and CSS code in separate files (HTML files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).

You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css

With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a 
page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.




When HTML and CSS code are in separate files, the files must be linked.
Otherwise, the HTML file won't be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied.

You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. 
The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. 
It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:

href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.

type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file).

The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.

rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. 
Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.

Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.

If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:

<link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">


all paragraph elements will be selected using a CSS selector. 
Note that the CSS selector matches the HTML tag for that element, but without the angle bracket

p {

}

CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes.
One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute.

To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the class's name.
In the example above case, the class is brand, so the CSS selector for it is .brand.

.brand {

}
