you learned about an important limitation of the default box model: box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.

Let's review what you learned:

In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.

The box-sizing property controls the box model used by the browser.

The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.

The value for the new box model is border-box.

The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding.


* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

It's that simple! In the example above, 
the universal selector (*) targets all elements on the web page and sets their box model to the border-box model.
